I'm a 5th Year Comp.Sci student from Simón Bolívar University that's highly passionate about math, PL and functional programming. 

I created this blog as a way to preserve the fun things I've come across during my college experience, and also with the hope that someday it will lead me to meet more mutuals that share the same interests.

If you are a recruiter then let me tell you, you sure are a lucky fellow! Because I'm currently looking for a position that allows me to push even further all this concepts through the industry lens. You can message me in [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-andres-pinto-alvarado-6563a0101/)

If you are just a curious individual that find these topics interesting (or have any recommendation) feel free to message! It's always amazing to exchange ideas c:
